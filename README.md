# ThriftFindr - Thriftstore Review Site

ThriftFindr is a user-review site similar to Yelp, made with Node, Express and Mongo. You can view the site at <https://thriftfindr.com>

ThriftFindr originally started as YelpCamp, the final project of Udemy's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/ "udemy.com"), but it transformed into its own thing when I added search functionality, Facebook authentication, the Google Places API, and a whole bunch of other features.
